## Environment overview and Setup 
Before starting the labs make sure to review the 

* **[Login to Platform Navigator.](Login-pn/index.md)** Steps to login to the Platform Navigator.   

* **[Setup Common registry for API Manager.](Login-apic/index.md)** Steps to setup co-authoring for APIC 

* **[VDI overview & instructions.](VDI-overview/index.md)** The following instructions are for accessing the needed resources for completing labs.   We will be using a shared cluster for most labs, but some will also use a common desktop (VDI) that contains the needed software. <br>
**NOTE: The PoT coordinator should have sent you an email with your student number and links to a VDI Linux desktop and the URL to be used to accessing the shared cluster.**
