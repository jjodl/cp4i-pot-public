# IBM APP-Connect
## Introduction
The labs are grouped under varies Experience and in each Experience, you will see various labs.  We will cover both the ACE Toolkit and ACE Designer to build integrations. We will be creating Event flows and APIs with Designer and then import them into APIC.

## Lab Abstracts

|  Subject                            | Description                                            |                                                               
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Toolkit Experience](Toolkit-Experience/index.md)       | **Basic PING flow with Toolkit** This is a basic toolkit lab that you will create a simple Ping flow and then test locally and deploy to the ACE runtime in CP4I.  We will also show how to distribute workloads using IBM App Connect Enterprise Callable Flows.<br><br>**Environments and Perquisite:** For these labs you will need to use the VDI.  It is best to login to the Cluster from the VDI. 
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [SalesForce Experience](SF-Experience/index.md)       | **Multi-Style Integration with IBM App Connect and IBM API Connect the SalesForce experience**  Create no-code integrations using IBM App Connect and expose and manage the APIs created with IBM API Connect. We will also show the value of Event Driven flows to react to events in backend systems. 
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [ServiceNow Experience](SN-Experience/index.md)       | **Multi-Style Integration with IBM App Connect and IBM API Connect the ServiceNow experience**  Create no-code integrations using IBM App Connect and expose and manage the APIs created with IBM API Connect. We will also show the value of Event Driven flows to react to events in backend systems.
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ACE Toolkit Labs**         | This section you will focus on basic as well as advance capabilities using ACE Toolkit to build integrations both API lead as well as Event Driven solutions. <br>**This lab is being worked on.** <br><br>**Environments:** For these labs you will need to use the VDI.
