# 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
The purpose of this LAB is to show how to retrieve ServiceNow Records using IBM App Connect Designer on IBM Cloud Pak for Integration.

If you need to review logging in to the Platform Navigator review the steps in the [Return to main lab page](../../../index.md#lab-sections)   

**Gathering your own ServiceNow Credentials**
- For this lab, you will be provided with shared credentials.  If you would like to use your own account you can follow these steps to collect your ServiceNow account details: Username, Password, Client Secret, and Client ID. You can learn how to obtain these values [here](../SNow-Pre-Lab/SNow-Pre-Lab.md) 

# 2. Create a Designer Flow in CP4I to Call ServiceNow  <a name="create_a_designer_flow_in_cp4i_to_call_servicenow"></a>

In this section, we use App Connect Designer to create a flow that will be exposed as an API to connect and call ServiceNow records.

3\. You will now be on your home page and it the upper left it will show your login name.   Under Integrations, click on the App Connect Designer link to take you to the designer dashboard.

![alt text][pic2]

4\. In the upper left, always make sure you are in the correct namespace.  Select the tab on the left to open the Catalog screen. The App Connect catalog provides a list of applications and APIs that are available.

![alt text][pic3]

5\. Click on the App Connect Designer dashboard icon:

![alt text][pic7]

6\. Select from the New drop down to create a new API flow:  

![alt text][pic8]

7\. First thing we will do is create the model for this.  We will call the model **ServiceNowRetrieve**.  Also in the upper left, we will change the Name from Untitled to **ServiceNowRetrieve**.  Click **Create model**.

![alt text][pic8a]

8\. We will map the following properties which are all data type String. You can also set the data type to Number for properties containing numerical integer values if it is needed.   For this they will all be strings.  

1.	SystemUserID
2.	FirstName
3.	LastName
4.	Email

![alt text][pic9]

9\. Now that we have defined the properties in our API model definition, we can implement a flow by clicking on the Operations tab. The Operations tab is located next to the Properties tab.
From the Operations drop-down menu **"Select an operation to add"**, select **Add a Custom Operation**. Here we will customize the operation that we want our API to perform. 

10\. Customize the details of your API operation. 
* **Note**: You can optionally set a description for your individual API operation. 
    * Display Name: **Retrieve SystemUsers**
    * HTTP Verb: **GET** 
    * Operation Name: **users**
        * Note: The operation name will be a part of your API Endpoint URL and is therefore consumer-facing.
    * Response body: **ServiceNowRetrieve**

11\. After customizing your API operation, the details should match the image below.

![alt text][pic11]

Now we can click the **Implement flow** button next to our API operation definition. This will take us to the App Connect Designer flow. This is where we can insert Smart Connectors to communicate with a variety of external applications as well as implement conditional logic and callable flows. 

12\. After clicking the blue plus icon on our flow designer interface, we will be able to see the variety of Smart Connectors offered by IBM App Connect Designer. 
* For our lab, we will be using the ServiceNow smart connector, so let us scroll down to the ServiceNow connector and select it.
Click on the **Connect to ServiceNow to see more items**.   

![alt text][pic13]

13\. This will open the connection screen.  You should see a credentials form populate your screen where you will enter your ServiceNow account credentials that were provided by the instructor or if you chose to use your own.
Click **Connect**

![alt text][pic13a]

You may see an error message pop-up for now just close this. 

![alt text][pic13b]

If you see **Account 1** listed under the ServiceNow connector, then it is connected.

![alt text][pic62]

14\. Now we will select the records we will access.   Select the **System user** and select **Retrieve system users**

![alt text][pic13c]

15\. The next interface that populates under our Designer flow allows us to add conditionals to our integration flow.    

In our example, we will retrieve the first 2 ServiceNow system users records. In order to do this, we can set the Maximum number of items to retrieve field to 2.  And then select, **Process 2 item from the collection** in the radio button options. As you can see there is also some error handling options provided by App Connect Designer below.

A helpful feature offered by the Smart Connectors is the **“Try this action”** . Clicking this button will allow you to test your ServiceNow connection. If your credentials and operations are configured correctly you should be able to pull records from ServiceNow. 

![alt text][pic14]

16\. You can now click on the **View details** to see the results.   This is done even before your API is complete and allows you to see info that is returned from ServiceNow to be mapped. 

![alt text][pic15]

17\. This shows the Test Results details.

![alt text][pic16]

18\. Now we can configure our API Response body to populate a successful response message with the data fields we are interested in returning to our consumer. Go ahead and click the **Response** task on the integration flow (outlined in the blue box below).

![alt text][pic17]

19\. Now we will map our API Response keys to the respective values we want our consumer to obtain from ServiceNow. Let us start with the **SystemUserID** field. 

* You can click on the hamburger icon next to SystemUserID field and you will see the list of Available mappings.
* For this lab, we will just start typing.   Type in **User** and you will see all the mappings found.  Select the **System user ID**

![alt text][pic18]

20\. After populating all the fields your mapping should match the image attached below. Click **Done** this will take you back to the main page for this API.

# 2a. Testing the API flow <a name="testing_the_API_flow"></a>

We will now start the API and this will make the Test button visible on the menu bar.

1\. Click in the upper right corner on the Stopped switch and it will turn green and show started.

![alt text][pic21]

2\. We will not go into details on all the items on the menu bar. For now we will focus on the Test button. Click on the **Test**  button. 
Then click on the Get operation on the left side under Overview. This will take you to the Details page for this operation. Scroll down and review the info. When ready to Test the API click on the Try it

![alt text][pic22]

3\. Now you will see the GET Url for our API and the Security key. Since we are not passing anything into the API we can just go ahead and Click on Send

![alt text][pic23]

4\. The API will run and you will see the Request details sent in as well as the Response from the API.

# 2b. Add an Additional Operation for our ServiceNow API <a name="add_an_additional_operation_for_our_servicenow_API"></a>

1\. In this section, we will add an additional operation to get System user by ID. First, we will stop the API. Click on the green Started switch in the upper right corner. This will take you to the designer page. Click on the **Operations** item.

1. ![alt text][pic25]

2\. Now select to add another operation and select the Retrieve ServiceNowRetrieve by ID.

![alt text][pic26]

3\. Select “Implement flow” for the new operation and that will get us to the flow editor where we will select the “+” sign and scroll down to ServiceNow connector and select **Retrieve system users**.

![alt text][pic27]
![alt text][pic27a]

4\. We will now add a condition to our API call so that we just get the System user ID that is passed in.  Click on the Add condition +

![alt text][pic28]

5\.  Now set the Where clause to **System user ID** and the available mapping will show the **SystemUserID** we pass to the API. 

![alt text][pic29]

6\. Now we will map our API Response keys to the respective values we want our consumer to obtain from ServiceNow. Let us start with the **SystemUserID** field. 

* You can click on the hamburger icon next to SystemUserID field and you will see the list of Available mappings.
* For this lab, we will just start typing.   Type in **Sys** and you will see all the mappings found.  Select the **System user ID** 
 
![alt text][pic30]

7\. After populating all the fields, your mapping should match the image attached below. Click **Done** this will take you back to the main page for this API.

# 2c. Testing the New API Operation <a name="testing_the_new_API"></a>
Make sure your API is running by checking the upper pane of your Designer instance. Since App Connect Designer has a built-in REST API testing utility. 

1\. Click in the upper right corner on the Stopped switch and it will turn green and show started. Click on the Test menu on top.

![alt text][pic32a]

2\. As you can see, we have two operations now.  One that will get us the first two accounts and the other will get account by id.   
So let’s first run the GET first to get a list of user IDs.  Now click on the **Try it** button. 

![alt text][pic32b]

3\. Scroll down and click on the Send button. This will trigger an API call to your Designer flow and in turn populate a Request and Response pane below the Send button.
* Save one of the SystemUserIDs for the next step
* **Note:** If you get an error the first time you click Send, click Send again

![alt text][pic32c]

4\. Now select the GET operation on the left menu and review the information on this new operation we just created.  You will see a required field for this API called **SystemUserID**.  Enter one of the SystemUserID from the last step.  Click **Send**.

![alt text][pic33]

5\. You will see the response for the SystemUserID that you entered for the API call. 
* **Note:** If you get an error the first time you click Send, click Send again

# 3. Deploying Your Designer Flow to App Connect Dashboard <a name="deploying_your_designer_flow_to_app_connect_dashboard"></a>

Now we can export our Designer flow to deploy to App Connect Dashboard on Cloud Pak for Integration. 

1\. Navigate to your App Connect Designer Dashboard so we can export our flow as a BAR file. The Dashboard for App Connect Designer is on the left-hand pane. After navigating to the Dashboard, click on the triple-dot icon on your Designer flow. Select **Export** and then select **Runtime Flow Asset (BAR).** This will allow you to download the BAR file to your local directory. 

![alt text][pic38]

* This will save the ServiceNowRetrieve.bar file locally on your machine and will use that to deploy to the AppConnect runtime. 

2\. Now we will go back to the Automation home page. Click on the IBM Automation on the top menu.
![alt text][pic39]

3\. From the Platform Navigator, select your App Connect Dashboard instance.
This is showing we are logged in as chopper15 which is your user id that you used to sign in with.  

![alt text][pic40]

4\.Now select **dashboard** on the left menu and then click the **Create server** option.

![alt text][pic41]

5\. We will now select the Designer Integration that we will deploy then click next.

![alt text][pic42]

6\. Now we will either drag and drop the BAR file we just exported or we can click to upload it.  Then click next.

![alt text][pic43]

7\. The next section is for configuration you can look at all the options that are available.   We will just be using the Designer Accounts which will include your ServiceNow credentials.
* **Note:** This takes a little time to populate.

![alt text][pic44]

8\. The final section is the server details.   We will give it a name **is-01-snow-designer** and change the Designer flows mode to local.

 Go ahead and click **Create**.

![alt text][pic45]

9\. This will take you back to the Servers Dashboard where you will see your new server.   It will be showing Pending while it is starting up the pods for it. 

![alt text][pic46]

10\. You can refresh the page to see if the status has changed.  It may take a couple minutes to start up all the needed pods depending on the workload of the cluster.
Once it is up and running it will show the following:

![alt text][pic47]

11\. We can also quickly test the API call running in the Integration server.  Click on the tile and you will see your API.  Click on the tile again and you will see the API test screen.
Select the Get accounts and then select the GET url and paste in a browser window.

![alt text][pic48]

12\. You will see the following results.
![alt text][pic50]

13\. One last step is to download the OpenAPI spec for this service for the next SN Experience lab.  Click on the Overview and below you will see where you can download the API yaml
